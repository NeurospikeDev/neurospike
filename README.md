# ðŸ§  Neurospike

This is a monorepo containing all open-source projects developed at Neurospike. Our mission is to provide *awesome tools for neural computation*. Each project is located within its designated folder and related information can be found on this page.

## Projects

Currently, there are two main projects being developed by Neurospike. These are **Eduspike** and our ongoing simulation library, **neurospikelib**.

### [Eduspike](https://github.com/NeurospikeDev/neurospike/tree/main/eduspike)

Eduspike allows for users to discover popular and relevant spiking neuron models in a sandbox style environment. Through a powerful visualisation module, built-in IDE and accompanying python library, we provide users a hands on experience with popular models such as the LIF and the Hodgkin Huxley neurons.

### [neurospikelib](https://github.com/NeurospikeDev/neurospike/tree/main/neurospikelib)

neurospikelib is a simple and evolving neural computation library. It is utilised by applications we develop and can also be used as a standalone Python library.
