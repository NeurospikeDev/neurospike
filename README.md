# Neurospike

This is a monorepo containing all, open-source projects developed at Neurospike. Our mission is to provide *awesome tools for neural computation*. Each project is located within its designated folder and related information can be found on this page.

## Projects

Currently, there are two main projects being developed by Neurospike. These are **Eduspike** and our ongoing simulation library, **neurospikelib**.

### Eduspike

Eduspike is an educational neural simulation tool that provides a modernised interface for interacting with computational neuron models. Through a powerful visualisation module, built-in IDE and integration with neurospikelib, we provide users a hands on experience with popular models such as the LIF and the Hodgkin Huxley neurons.
