This is a monorepo containing all, open-source projects developed at Neurospike. Our mission is to provide *awesome tools for neural computation*. Each project is located within its designated folder and related information can be found on this page.

## Projects

Currently, there are two main projects being developed by Neurospike. These are **Eduspike** and our ongoing simulation library, **neurospikelib**.
