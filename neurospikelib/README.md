# Neurospikelib

Neurospikelib is a simple and evolving spiking neuron computation library. It is utilised by applications we develop and can also be used
as a standalone Python library. 

## Roadmap
Our current API only supports simulating LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) models. Future neuron models we are developing throughout 2024 include:
* EIF (Exponential Integrate-and-Fire)
* Hodgkin-Huxley
* AdEx (Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire)
* Izhikevich Model
